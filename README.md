# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Karthik!
I am a CS undergrad at [Canara Engineering College](https://cec.canaraengineeringcollege.in/), with a strong passion for front-end development. I specialize in creating user-friendly and visually engaging digital experiences using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Recently, Iâ€™ve been extending my knowledge into backend development, working with technologies like Node.js, Express, and Firebase.
Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growing in both front-end and backend developmet. Iâ€™m dedicated to my work and excited to take on new challenges.
